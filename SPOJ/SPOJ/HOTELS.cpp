/**
 * SPOJ Problem Set (classical)
 * 9861. Hotels Along the Croatian Coast
 * Problem code: HOTELS
 *
 * There are N hotels along the beautiful Adriatic coast. Each hotel
 * has its value in Euros.
 *
 * Sroljo has won M Euros on the lottery. Now he wants to buy a
 * sequence of consecutive hotels, such that the sum of the values of
 * these consecutive hotels is as great as possible - but not greater
 * than M.
 *
 * You are to calculate this greatest possible total value.
 * Input
 *
 * In the first line of the input there are integers N and M (1 . N .
 * 300 000, 1 . M < 231).
 *
 * In the next line there are N natural numbers less than 106,
 * representing the hotel values in the order they lie along the
 * coast.
 * Output
 *
 * Print the required number (it will be greater than 0 in all of the
 * test data).
 * Example
 * input
 *
 * 5 12
 * 2 1 3 4 5
 *
 * output
 *
 * 12
 *
 *      input
 *
 *      4 9
 *      7 3 5 6
 *
 *      output
 *
 *      8

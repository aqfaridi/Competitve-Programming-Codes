/**
 * SPOJ Problem Set (classical)
 * 3923. Philosophers Stone
 * Problem code: BYTESM2
 *
 * One of the secret chambers in Hogwarts is full of philosopher.s
 * stones. The floor of the chamber is covered by h Ã—w square tiles,
 * where there are h rows of tiles from front (first row) to back
 * (last row) and w columns of tiles from left to right. Each tile has
 * 1 to 100 stones on it. Harry has to grab as many philosopher.s
 * stones as possible, subject to the following restrictions:
 *
 *     He starts by choosing any tile in the first row, and collects
 *     the philosopher.s stones on that tile. Then, he moves to a tile
 *     in the next row, collects the philosopher.s stones on the tile,
 *     and so on until he reaches the last row.
 *         When he moves from one tile to a tile in the next row, he
 *         can only move to the tile just below it or diagonally to
 *         the left or right.
 *
 *         Given the values of h and w, and the number of
 *         philosopher.s stones on each tile, write a program to
 *         compute the maximum possible number of philosopher.s stones
 *         Harry can grab in one single trip from the first row to the
 *         last row.
 *         Input
 *
 *         The first line consists of a single integer T, the number
 *         of test cases. In each of the test cases, the first line
 *         has two integers. The first integer h (1<=h<=100) is the
 *         number of rows of tiles on the floor. The second integer w
 *         (1<=w<=100) is the number of columns of tiles on the floor.
 *         Next, there are h lines of inputs. The ith line of these,
 *         specifies the number of philosopher.s stones in each tile
 *         of the ith row from the front. Each line has w integers,
 *         where each integer m (0<=m<=100) is the number of
 *         philosopher.s stones on that tile. The integers are
 *         separated by a space character.
 *         Output
 *
 *         The output should consist of T lines, (1<=T<=100), one for
 *         each test case. Each line consists of a single integer,
 *         which is the maximum possible number of philosopher.s
 *         stones Harry can grab, in one single trip from the first
 *         row to the last row for the corresponding test case.
 *         Example
 *
 *         Input:
 *         1
 *         6 5
 *         3 1 7 4 2
 *         2 1 3 1 1
 *         1 2 2 1 8
 *         2 2 1 5 3
 *         2 1 4 4 4
 *         5 2 7 5 1
 *
 *         Output:
 *         32   
 *
